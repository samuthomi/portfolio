                <h2>Context and stakes</h2>
                <p>A year after launching Sendy Fulfillment, sellers loved storing stock at fulfillment centers because it reduced delivery lead times and simplified operations. That success exposed the next opportunity: help sellers move from "stored inventory" to completed sales, without extra manual work.</p>
                <p>The idea was a self-checkout storefront: sellers publish a simple web page showing items available in the warehouse, customers purchase directly, and Sendy handles delivery—automating the sales loop end-to-end.</p>

                <h2>What was actually blocking progress</h2>

                <div class="pull-quote">
                    <p>This wasn't a "design a storefront page" problem. The risk was shipping a storefront that didn't match how sellers build trust, price products, and close payments in the real world.</p>
                </div>

                <p>We needed to validate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Would sellers trust Sendy to collect payments?</li>
                    <li>What payment options were non-negotiable?</li>
                    <li>What must be configurable for sellers to run a real business?</li>
                    <li>What is the smallest product that still works in-market?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Approach: validate direction before we build</h2>
                <p>Because this was a new product concept, we started with a demo-first approach—prototype quickly, test with existing sellers, then let that feedback define what mattered for a first release.</p>

                <h3>Demo 1 — Early signal, fast learning</h3>
                <p>I built a rough mobile concept and turned it into an interactive prototype to test with five sellers.</p>
                <p><strong>What we learned:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Setup + checkout felt intuitive, but sellers wanted fewer steps.</li>
                    <li>Sellers were excited about Sendy collecting payments through the storefront.</li>
                    <li>Some wanted deeper branding/customization (background images, custom colors).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What changed after Demo 1:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We tightened the flow around momentum: publish/share sooner, configure later.</li>
                    <li>We treated "payment collection" as a value anchor worth designing around.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Demo 2 — Higher fidelity, real constraints</h3>
                <p>With more confidence in the direction, we tested a higher-fidelity prototype with 20 participants to shape the backlog for a first release.</p>
                <p><strong>Key insights that reshaped the product:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Payment on Delivery (cash or mobile money) was crucial for customer trust.</li>
                    <li>Sellers wanted flexible price configuration to pass fulfilment/delivery fees to customers (but it would require more dev time).</li>
                    <li>Promotions mattered: discounts and bundling to drive sales.</li>
                    <li>Sellers needed low stock notifications to manage demand and avoid failures.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Key decisions</h2>
                <p>This project became a sequence of product decisions, not a UI exercise:</p>
                <p><strong>Optimize for seller momentum, not completeness</strong> — Reduce steps and get sellers to a shareable storefront quickly.</p>
                <p><strong>Treat trust mechanisms as core</strong> — Payment on Delivery wasn't a "phase two" feature—it was foundational to adoption.</p>
                <p><strong>Separate "must-have" from "expensive-to-build"</strong> — Pricing configuration was important, but we acknowledged the dev cost and planned it intentionally rather than sneaking it into v1.</p>
                <p><strong>Bake growth into the product</strong> — Discounts and bundling weren't extras—they were how sellers sell.</p>

                <h2>Final design solution</h2>
                <p>We finalized the design and handed off for development. The solution included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A desktop + mobile storefront where customers can browse and place orders.</li>
                    <li>A new Storefront tab inside the Sendy Fulfillment app to manage catalog, customize the page, and share product/store links.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>The work was handed off, but it was never released due to layoffs and shifting business priorities.</p>
                <p>Even without launch, we validated what would make a storefront viable in-market—trust, payment expectations, seller pricing needs, and lightweight setup—before investing heavily in build.</p>

                <h2>Reflections</h2>
                <p>Involving customers early and often helped us focus on problems that were meaningful to sellers—and avoid building something that looked good but wouldn't be adopted.</p>
