    <!-- Case Study Content -->
    <section class="case-study-content">

            <div class="content">
                <p>In 2022, Sendy successfully expanded operations into Nigeria, with customers swiftly adopting the platform for delivery services. As we analyzed customer feedback, we saw an opportunity to enhance their payment experience by introducing a bank transfer payment method in addition to the existing card payments and mobile money options, the latter of which was not as widely utilized in Nigeria.</p>
                <p>Sendy had also entered into a partnership with OnePipe (a Nigerian Fintech) for payment integration in the Nigerian market.</p>

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>Our goal was to create a bank transfer payment method specifically tailored for Nigerian customers, offering them an alternative to card payments for their orders.</p>

                <h2>Impact</h2>

                <div class="key-metrics">
                    <div class="key-metric">
                        <div class="key-metric-number">90%</div>
                        <div class="key-metric-label">Payment success rate</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="key-metric">
                        <div class="key-metric-number">200+</div>
                        <div class="key-metric-label">Customers reusing the payment method within 30 days from launch</div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Empathy — User interviews</h2>
                <p>In order to fully capitalize on this opportunity, it was important for us to understand the intricacies of our Nigerian merchants—our target audience. This would help us better understand their daily routines and habits, as we aimed to introduce virtual wallets as a new payment option.</p>
                <p>Despite facing time constraints and resource limitations, we crafted a research plan to guide our interactions with customers. This involved determining the number of merchants we aimed to engage with and fine-tuning our interview questions.</p>
                <p>Our interview sessions yielded mixed results. Some conversations with customers were enlightening and productive, while others proved to be more challenging, especially when speaking to merchants on the move during their busy schedules.</p>

                <h3>Key findings</h3>
                <p><strong>New entrepreneurs.</strong> In our interviews with 8 merchants, it became clear that most of them had recently established businesses. These entrepreneurs expressed great satisfaction with the convenience that the Sendy platform provided for their operations. By simplifying the process of fulfilling orders through bike riders or navigating the complexities of commuting in Lagos, Sendy had significantly alleviated their logistical challenges.</p>
                <p><strong>Issues with card payments.</strong> Interestingly, all merchants unanimously favored bank transfers as their preferred method of payment. They cited past issues with card payments and expressed a preference for the reliability of bank transfers. Additionally, two respondents mentioned a preference for PayPal deposits over debit card transactions, as the former seemed to offer a higher success rate.</p>

                <h2>Define — Solution focus</h2>
                <p>The feedback we got from the interview sessions gave us the confidence to invest further in a bank transfer solution. Key areas of this solution that needed to be addressed were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Onboarding new customers for a virtual bank account.</li>
                    <li>Ensuring users verify phone numbers as required by Nigerian banking regulations.</li>
                    <li>Mapping journeys for virtual bank account top-up and customer checkout.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="pull-quote">
                    <p>Our design goal was to create an account-to-account transfer experience that enables customers to confirm payments instantly.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Ideate — User flows</h2>
                <p>We prepared user flows to address all three areas our solution needed to cover and shared them with all product squads, finance stakeholders, and partners (OnePipe) to ensure alignment.</p>
                <p>Creating the user flows was helpful because it helped the team spot challenges with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>KYC Verification Enhancements:</strong> Initially, certain details were unclear, but by developing structured flows, the team and stakeholders aligned on the requirements. The emphasis was on ensuring a positive experience during virtual account setup.</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment Method Onboarding:</strong> The flow analysis revealed the necessity of providing clear onboarding information to swiftly acquaint users with how Pay by Bank operates, encouraging them to adopt this option.</li>
                    <li><strong>Addressing Payment Confirmation Delays:</strong> By identifying potential reasons for delays in payment confirmation, we could inform customers of possible challenges and guide them on resolving issues promptly.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>UI design</h3>
                <p>We bypassed the wireframing phase due to time constraints in preparing UI designs. However, significant clarity and alignment were achieved during the user flow discussions.</p>
                <p>We developed interface screens to accommodate both mobile and web platforms for this solution.</p>

                <h2>Deliver — Beta testing & release</h2>
                <p>We enlisted five customers and launched a beta version of the payment method to gather feedback on their user experience. During this phase, we identified several issues:</p>
                <p><strong>Challenges with Bank Transfer Confirmations:</strong> Some customers experienced frustration due to delays in bank transfer confirmations, leading to uncertainty. Initially overlooked as our Partner had promised instant confirmation, we addressed this by introducing a screen with a countdown to manage customer expectations regarding confirmation times.</p>
                <p><strong>Enhancements for Insufficient Funds Scenarios:</strong> Previously, customers were unable to proceed with their orders if funds were insufficient, a restriction that was frustrating our test customers and we realized that it was creating an extra step for customers that wasn't necessary. To resolve this, we revised the flow to allow users to click on the 'Confirm Order' button, triggering a prompt only if funds were inadequate.</p>
                <p>Following the design enhancements, we shared the updates for implementation. After a two-week sprint, we successfully rolled out Pay by Bank to customers in Nigeria.</p>

                <h2>Learnings</h2>
                <p>Conducting remote interviews with customers was a new experience for me. The logistics differed significantly from meeting participants in person, and I am incredibly grateful to my team members in Nigeria for their invaluable assistance in recruiting participants.</p>
                <p>I also learned that remote interviews require a flexible approach to scheduling, as participants are likely to request rescheduling hours or even days later.</p>
                <p>Working on payment systems provided me with a wealth of knowledge, as this payment method was a new concept for me. It challenged me to lead design efforts to create a user-friendly experience for individuals in a different part of the world.</p>
